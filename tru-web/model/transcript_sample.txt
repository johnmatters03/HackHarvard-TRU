And that recording now one must not get one's knickers in a twist and turn, these are the stories your
granny never told the people loved by everybody. I was raising the country's until I slipped up on some
spilled onions on the road and my motorbike. Hi, guys, it's Nikki, your host for the stories your granny
never told podcast coming back at you this month for a brand new episode. Stories Your Granny
Never Told is a monthly podcast where I interview older folks about their unexpected life stories.
[00:00:41.390]
And this month is no different. This month, I get to talk to Lynn Ruth Miller, who's an 86 year old
comedian, and she's frickin hilarious. I mean, we talked for so long and we went on a few tangents
and I think we got to about when she was 35 years old and we went way over time. So I had to ask her
a bunch of questions at the end. But it's still really great and I think you still get the whole picture.
[00:01:05.150]
I will, however, put a little warning we do for something like half of the episode, talk in depth about
eating disorders. So if that's something that you don't want to hear about, maybe just skip this one.
Just a little notification at the top here. I'm running a giveaway for the brand new merch that I have,
which is all the quotes.
[00:01:24.440]
The advice quotes from the grandmas and grandpas of the previous episodes go head over to stories
your granny never told on Instagram. And you can find that post and comment and like and follow and
share with all your friends. And you can get a chance to win a cool mask or something or t shirt.
Anyways, without any further ado, here is the interview with Lindros Miller. Can we start out with your
name, what you would like me to call you and your age?
[00:01:53.960]
OK, I'm Leonard Miller and I'd like you to call me then Ruth and I am eighty six. Almost eighty seven. I'll
be eighty seven in for three months. OK, congratulations. Not even two months.
[00:02:08.980]
All right. And so you are a comedian.
[00:02:11.770]
I'm a I'm more than that. I'm a comedian. I'm a performer. I'm a storyteller. I'm a cabaret performer. I
do burlesque and also write my book. Just my book was just posted on Amazon today. Yeah.
[00:02:26.140]
You have a. Oh, really? Congratulations. You have multiple books.
[00:02:29.230]
You have multiple. But this is the memoir. Oh wow. Oh I have to read it. I'm excited. Well of you, if you
like comedy, it tells pretty much how I formulate a set. It really is.
[00:02:42.850]
And in the end, the advertising that we never put that in there. But I've got a whole chapter where I tell
you just exactly how what what gets a laugh, whether what to do when it doesn't. I analyze a whole
set for you. It's one little chapter and you have a lot of experience in that.
[00:03:01.720]
I well, I started when I was 70. I didn't start. It's not like comedy. Yeah.
[00:03:07.960]
How how did things start out? Where did you grow up?
[00:03:11.020]
I grew up in Toledo, Ohio. And I majored in education. I have a great I have a great deal of education,

and I was just talking to my wonderful friend from Florida to me, and she's made a beautiful economic
success of herself. She's very wealthy. I am not. And she said I don't see the point of a lot of
education. I don't think it teaches you anything. And I thought, my God, I've been to six universities.
[00:03:37.420]
I have three advanced degrees. What kind of. And I'm trying to get a Ph.D.. That's the next door really
right now, honey, all that money I wasted because, well, she has a lot more street smarts than I do.
And I'm sure you do that because I enjoy a lot more sex than I am as well.
[00:03:58.090]
But I'm sure you go through all this education because you enjoy it. I actually just got my Ph.D. like
three months ago, so it was in biology and biology. That's interesting. I want to do it, actually. I'd like
to do it on some form of theater. It's about ageism. I believe that we get our concept of what age is
like from what we see in the media. Oh, absolutely. And I want to destroy that.
[00:04:26.410]
That's one of the reasons I'm doing this podcast, is because, like in the street, if you see a little old
granny, like, hunched over with her cane, you think like, oh, she's innocent. And then you don't realize
that that's a person and she has great stories and she probably punch a Nazi in the face back in the
day. And you would have never known if you didn't do it today as well. Yeah, I hope so.
[00:04:44.710]
I cannot stand the people being patronising to me. And I and I see it all the time. I know it's a reflex in
a group. And I will I'll give an opinion and everyone will smile and totally ignore it.
[00:04:59.230]
Mm hmm. So on top of being a woman, being an older woman is just double's it.
[00:05:03.820]
I'm sure it's been an absolute hell, but I never realized how much of it was due to ageism and sexism,
because what you do, and this is for most of us in the profession is you think, well, I guess I'm just not
good enough.
[00:05:15.400]
Yeah. You internalize it and turn it into sort of an imposter syndrome when it's actually a societal
problem, huh? Oh, yeah.
[00:05:23.950]
Being a woman in science, it happens a lot.
[00:05:27.040]
In science, you would know that everything in gerontology is spent and how to get them well and
prevent sickness. That has what it should be. It should be and how to give them options for a full life.
If when I turn 65, all I did is take the pension that I got and go out and play and do golf and that's that's
waiting to die. I don't want to do that. I got all the plan that I needed when I was five and six.
[00:05:56.020]
I want purpose for living and I have very purpose for women.
[00:06:00.340]
So when you when you were younger, so you grew up in the States and then you decided to pursue a
bunch of stuff.
[00:06:07.570]
I was 80. OK, OK. So you've lived almost your whole life in the States. Right. And you you want to a
bunch of universities or is it just because you enjoyed learning in general or you couldn't decide what
you wanted to do?

[00:06:20.620]
It was, you know, what I wanted to do. Ah, you have to think about the mindset once that this is the
30s where women, women never expected to work for the rest of their lives, they were supported by
your husband. So the first 20 years was looking for a husband and not finding one. And then no. So I.
So when I got a degree, one of people always say, do you regret anything? And I would say, no.
[00:06:48.120]
But there is one thing I regret. I regret that my mindset would not permit me to major in what I loved,
which at that time would have been creative writing. Mm hmm. I was a writer. I've been a writer since I
was 10. Oh, well, yeah, that would have changed really the whole life. But you had to earn a living and
you had what you thought of that. This is in the late forties, used to get an interim job, not for life till
you married and then you probably work for a couple years to accumulate money while he was
establishing himself.
[00:07:30.270]
So you'll figure, what do you train for? They only going to do for about five years. And so I trained to
be an elementary school teacher. I didn't train for that. I trained to be a kindergarten teacher. But I got
my job as an elementary school, which is another mistake. But I. I understand why I made that one.
[00:07:49.020]
Yeah, that's an interesting prospect to see. Like, OK, you're going to have a job for five years, so just
pick something and then whatever. It doesn't matter.
[00:07:55.140]
And I happen to love children. I wanted children and I and I have been doing daycare since I was 14.
So this was a natural for me. I want to do kindergarten, not grade school, but as the story of my work,
you should get my book. Yeah, it's got that in there. But I have the job when I graduated. I seem to
have a knack for graduating when when the profession I'm trying to graduate in. His beloved died,
they didn't want kindergarten teachers, which is what I wanted to do.
[00:08:26.880]
I never, ever wanted to teach a subject ever. But I had to support myself. Yeah, I didn't have a husband
and I didn't have a relationship when I graduated from Michigan. And even then, when the sort of
women workforce was happening in America because the men were like off to war, they didn't sort of
think about future careers for women.
[00:08:50.250]
No, they couldn't wait to get out of the factories and back into the home, OK? It was a shame because
a lot more could have happened to them. And then you probably don't remember any of this. There
was a woman named Veronica Lake who was very popular, who wore her hair draped over warm high.
And all the women of America wanted to be beautiful, like Veronica Lake. So they left her her role. And
when they worked in the factories, they got caught in the machinery.
[00:09:17.990]
So Veronica Lake did a wonderful thing for the war effort. I still remember to cut her hair. Yeah. And
we had Rosie the Riveter. Yes. At the end. But that was when I was a child. But so there was no
interruption that did not change my sense that I wanted to I wanted to get married and have children.
That was what little girls wanted. And I wanted it. And I did not have a happy childhood.
[00:09:50.160]
I had a miserable childhood. But however, I did not have a monetarily I was not monetarily deprived.
My father was wealthy in that sense, I was privileged, but I had a very, very turbulent childhood and I
was determined to do it better. Of course, when I do it better and I was very progressive. People don't
know about the University of Michigan, but they're learning now because Sasha, who was Obama's
kid, is the University of Michigan.

[00:10:26.410]
So now they know it's an amazingly great school, but nobody knew about it. I went to undergraduate
there and at Michigan was very, very avant garde and very, very progressive. But even and I was very
progressive. I mean, I wanted to live on a farm where my children would have instead of a swing, we
have a tire that they would you know, we would make our own we grow our own food and we'd make
we bake together and we'd make our own entertainment.
[00:10:59.900]
And I know I would have sounds great if I would have gotten otherwise, I would have killed myself. But
that was what I didn't realize, that I am a product of a decadent age.
[00:11:12.340]
It's amazing.
[00:11:13.990]
So all of that's what I wanted and I wanted when I would talk about what I wanted with my life, you
could almost hear the violins playing and. Thank God I didn't get it. I've always said that not one single
dream that I had came true and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:11:34.550]
That's a really good way of looking at things.
[00:11:36.320]
And it's really true. It's really true. I have I have the most beautiful life right now. That's great.
[00:11:45.080]
So after you went to become a teacher, what happened after that? I found a husband.
[00:11:51.380]
OK, so you always wanted to do it and you finally found. I actually found you. I found a husband we
married. He went to Harvard Business School. I helped pay the tuition I taught, but that's what we did,
OK. Educated. He was also I went to undergraduate University of Michigan. I knew him from
Michigan. OK, and then we moved back to Toledo, Ohio, which I still can't. Get through my head. I
know what I know, which is something that would be very foreign to you.
[00:12:26.990]
We did it because he wanted to. You have to understand that you belong to your husband. Yeah, I do.
He wanted to when he was from New York is beyond me, but he did. And we got to Toledo, Ohio, and I
think there three months and then he left. And I also had a very severe eating disorder. I had anorexia
and bulimia. So if he hadn't left, I'd be dead. But I'm not where I am.
[00:12:54.920]
And so that's why I'm directing that. Thank God it didn't come to YMCA.
[00:13:01.130]
And then I started a TV show on CBS.
[00:13:04.760]
How did you get into that? I think the people don't realize that if you really want to do something, you
can, OK, so you just you just did it.
[00:13:15.050]
That's pretty much what happened to you. You you. I have no background. I have no training. I have no
idea. I didn't know what I don't know what a camera was, but I had graduated from Michigan, a very
idealistic teacher. I mean, I remember one of the books was called New Ways of Discipline. You know,
when I was young, they used to smack you, but I knew Ways was reflecting.

[00:13:39.650]
I don't know whether, you know, the Rogers technique, uh, that's maybe like the patient, what the
patient says you were what would throw a wet washcloth at another kid. You would say, oh, Ronald,
you didn't mean to do that, did you? And Ronald would say, yes, I certainly did. I know if you want to
kill them, but you reflect. You reflect that. Yes, you certainly did. Yes. I think you just reflect what they
say.
[00:14:07.430]
It's a rather there's new ways of discipline. I remember that I what I remember most about it as we
were studying new ways of discipline. And at the beginning of the course, there was a woman there
that was pregnant and for them and all the way through, she was getting bigger and bigger. And at our
last day, which was our exam, she wasn't there because she was giving birth unlucky. And I don't
know what she did with the kid, but I know she didn't hit him because when he learned, she learned
the whole court.
[00:14:36.020]
Well, it's reflective. She reflected its feelings when it was born. Yeah, that's what happened. So I was
very idealistic about everything I had seen. Oh, and then by the time I started Romper Room, I had a
master's degree in education because after my first divorce, I was at a loss. And whenever I'm at a
loss, I go to the school.
[00:14:57.470]
So I that's a pretty good way of coping with that. It's wonderful. Yeah. And it's really the best way
because you don't have time to feel sorry for yourself. They just got to work. You have and it's worth I
mean, you've got things you got to do. So I have a master's degree in Creative Arts for Children. And I
saw Romper Room, which is a big program at that time, and it violated every thing I have learned in
school.
